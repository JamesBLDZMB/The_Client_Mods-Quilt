# The Client Mods
This is a lite modpack made for clients, it won't modify your game too heavily and should be safe to use & fully functional on Servers. It is designed to provide useful tools & optimisations, this pack has neat HUDs and more, and the mods shouldn't get you banned from servers (check if they are allowed before joining though).
